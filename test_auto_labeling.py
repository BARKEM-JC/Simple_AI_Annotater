Test Documentation: Automatic Label Assignment Feature

This document explains how the automatic label assignment feature works
in the AI Dataset Labeler application.

FEATURE OVERVIEW:
================
When creating a new annotation (region), the system now automatically 
assigns the currently selected label from the Label Manager if one is 
available. The "Apply Label" button is still available for changing 
labels after creation.

HOW IT WORKS:
============
1. User selects a label by:
   - Choosing from predefined labels dropdown
   - Clicking on a custom label from the list
   - Typing directly in the label input field

2. User draws a new region/annotation by dragging on the video frame

3. The system automatically:
   - Creates the region
   - Assigns the current label from the label input field
   - Saves the annotation to file

WORKFLOW:
========
Before (old workflow):
1. Draw region
2. Select region  
3. Choose label
4. Click "Apply Label"
5. Save

After (new workflow):
1. Choose label first
2. Draw region → Label automatically applied and saved

BENEFITS:
========
- Faster annotation workflow
- Reduces clicks and manual steps
- Less prone to forgetting to label regions
- "Apply Label" button still available for corrections

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
=====================
Key changes made:

1. Added get_current_label() method to LabelManager class
   - Returns the text from current_label_input field

2. Modified on_region_added() method in AILabelerMainWindow
   - Gets current label from label manager
   - Automatically applies it to new regions
   - Saves annotations immediately

3. Maintained existing "Apply Label" functionality
   - Users can still change labels after creation
   - Manual labeling workflow still supported

TECHNICAL FLOW:
==============
VideoPlayer.mouseReleaseEvent() 
  → emits region_added signal
  → AILabelerMainWindow.on_region_added()
  → LabelManager.get_current_label()
  → VideoPlayer.set_region_label() 
  → save_frame_annotations()

FILES MODIFIED:
==============
- label_manager.py: Added get_current_label() method
- ai_labeler.py: Modified on_region_added() method

    This function provides a step-by-step test case for the feature:
    
    Test Case: Auto-label assignment
    
    Preconditions:
    - AI Labeler application is running
    - Video or images are loaded
    
    Steps:
    1. In the Label Manager panel, select or type a label (e.g., "person")
    2. Navigate to the video frame where you want to add annotation
    3. Draw a bounding box by clicking and dragging on the video
    4. Release mouse button
    
    Expected Result:
    - Region is created with the selected label automatically applied
    - Region appears with the label text displayed
    - Annotation is automatically saved to file
    - "Apply Label" button remains available for changes
    
    Additional Tests:
    - Test with empty label (should create region without label)
    - Test with predefined labels
    - Test with custom labels
    - Test "Apply Label" button still works for changing labels
